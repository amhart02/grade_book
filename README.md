## Overview

**Project Title**: Grade Book

**Project Description**: A program where teachers can view their courses and students in each course along with their grades. The teacher can then change grades, add and remove students, and view all the information for their courses. 

**Project Goals**: Build a program in Java using conditionals, loops, functions, classes, ArrayLists, and reading and writing from a file. 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

* Ensure Java is downloaded
* Create a main java file
* Create other necessary java class files 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Using VS code, run the program using the main file
2. Follow the instructions and use the grade book as necessary

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Java 
* VS Code (or other coding application)
